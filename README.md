## Ecommerce Sales Analysis using SQL

### Project Overview

Welcome to the **Ecommerce Sales Analysis using SQL** project! In this project, I dove into a comprehensive dataset to uncover valuable insights about ecommerce sales. The dataset consists of 21 features and 51,291 records, which provided a rich ground for analysis.

### Dataset
The data I worked with is quite extensive, featuring:
- **Rows:** 51,291
- **Columns:** 21

This dataset contains ecommerce sales information, detailing individual orders, customer details, product information, sales performance, and shipping specifics. Key data points include order IDs, order dates, shipping dates, shipping modes, customer names, customer segments, geographical information (state, country, market, and region), product IDs, product categories, sales figures, quantities ordered, discounts applied, profit margins, shipping costs, order priorities, and the year of the order.

Each record represents an individual order, allowing for detailed analysis of sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and logistics efficiency across different markets and regions. This dataset can be used to assess key metrics such as total sales, profit margins, the impact of discounts, and shipping cost efficiency, helping businesses optimize operations and understand their customer base better

### Analysis Questions
Throughout this project, I sought to answer some key questions that are crucial for understanding the business better:

1. **Which are the top 5 states with the highest shipping costs?**
2. **Which products or categories are bestsellers, and how have their sales changed over time?**
3. **Which customer groups spend the most money with us?**
4. **How do discounts affect our sales and profits?**
5. **What are the shipping costs for different delivery methods, and how do they impact our profits?**
6. **Which regions are generating the most sales and profits for us?**
7. **What is the average amount customers spend per order in different regions?**
8. **What are our monthly sales trends?**
9. **How does prioritizing orders affect delivery times and customer satisfaction?**
10. **How much money can we expect to make from each customer over their lifetime?**
11. **Are there signs that some customers might stop buying from us?**
12. **Are there seasonal trends in our sales?**
13. **Which products are frequently bought together?**

### Technologies Used
In this project, I primarily used SQL for data manipulation and analysis.
