## Ecommerce Sales Analysis using SQL

### Project Overview

Welcome to the **Ecommerce Sales Analysis using SQL** project! In this project, I dove into a comprehensive dataset to uncover valuable insights about ecommerce sales. The dataset consists of 21 features and 51,291 records, which provided a rich ground for analysis.

### Dataset
The data I worked with is quite extensive, featuring:
- **Rows:** 51,291
- **Columns:** 21
This dataset allows for a deep dive into various aspects of ecommerce sales.

### Analysis Questions
Throughout this project, I sought to answer some key questions that are crucial for understanding the business better:

1. **Which are the top 5 states with the highest shipping costs?**
2. **Which products or categories are bestsellers, and how have their sales changed over time?**
3. **Which customer groups spend the most money with us?**
4. **How do discounts affect our sales and profits?**
5. **What are the shipping costs for different delivery methods, and how do they impact our profits?**
6. **Which regions are generating the most sales and profits for us?**
7. **What is the average amount customers spend per order in different regions?**
8. **What are our monthly sales trends?**
9. **How does prioritizing orders affect delivery times and customer satisfaction?**
10. **How much money can we expect to make from each customer over their lifetime?**
11. **Are there signs that some customers might stop buying from us?**
12. **Are there seasonal trends in our sales?**
13. **Which products are frequently bought together?**

### Technologies Used
In this project, I primarily used SQL for data manipulation and analysis.
